# FC Tracker
Tracking tool for EA Sports FC 24's Manager Career mode. PC version only.

FC Tracker provides a graphical user interface (offline html) for viewing events, statistics about your manager career mode savefile. What data and how this data is presented is largely inspired by transfermarkt.com website.

# How it works
For making all these data accessible the following steps are made:
- At first run of FC Tracker game assets (team crests, player faces, ...) are extracted
- Manager career savefiles made by FC 24 are copied and processed, resulting in a .fct file
- In the html gui app these .fct files can be loaded in and viewed, extracted game assets are linked in by their ids
